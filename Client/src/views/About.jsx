      <p>“Hello, I’m a self-taught programmer and I’m passionate about tech, videogames and building things for the web. I started my journey as a developer last year. I followed a guide on MDN on how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web-page on my own, and once that happened, I was completely hooked to the world of web-development.
      </p>
      <p>Lately, I’ve discovered my passion for the world of web-development and the beauty behind creating useful websites. I’m now looking for a junior dev position to finally kick start my career and learn among professionals.”
